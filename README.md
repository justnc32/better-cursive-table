# better-cursive-table

Fork of [cursive_table_view](https://github.com/BonsaiDen/cursive_table_view), which is effectively deprecated.

- All original functionality
- Added 'sortability' feature for all tables to deactivate sort features


This is my first public project so I don't think I'm doing this right but whatever
